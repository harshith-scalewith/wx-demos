Input:
Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to sustainability, including practices and disclosures related to sustainable packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability. If, as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. As the nature, scope and complexity of sustainability reporting, due diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to incur additional costs to control, assess and report on sustainability metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and targets or to satisfy various sustainability reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation. Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs. There are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment, particularly in the worlds waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a circular economy.

It specifically mentions reducing waste from plastic bottles and efficient resource utilization through circular economics.
- Food and Hunger: Since this passage discusses the environmental effects of plastic bottles used for beverages, it indirectly addresses the broader topic of food and hunger because these containers often contain food items like soft drinks that people consume daily. Even though there isn't an immediate connection between them, both topics share some common ground.
- Economic Empowerment and Workforce Development: Although not explicitly mentioned here, this cause area can still relate to the discussion around sustainability practices and meeting stakeholder demands.

Input:
Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to sustainability, including practices and disclosures related to sustainable packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability. If, as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. As the nature, scope and complexity of sustainability reporting, due diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to incur additional costs to control, assess and report on sustainability metrics.

Input:
In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or spurious products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply 17 chain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper animal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our Companys overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products acceptance by consumers.

Input:
In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or spurious products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply 17 chain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper animal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our Companys overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products acceptance by consumers.
