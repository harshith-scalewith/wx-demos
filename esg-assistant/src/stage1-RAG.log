Also, as permitted by local law, during the annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness. We support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion networks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide employees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common interests or backgrounds. Talent and Development Through our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop our talent for acceleration in our networked organization. We believe in providing challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to our people to help them develop and grow. In 2022, we launched a global career strategy program called Thrive, which is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a career at the Company. Through our people-centered approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring career experience. We believe that development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences.

When appropriate, we adjust base pay. Also, as permitted by local law, during the annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness. We support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion networks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide employees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common interests or backgrounds. Talent and Development Through our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop our talent for acceleration in our networked organization. We believe in providing challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to our people to help them develop and grow. In 2022, we launched a global career strategy program called Thrive, which is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a career at the Company. Through our people-centered approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring career experience. We believe that development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences.

We have established specific ESG goals related to water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of added sugar in our beverages; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable agriculture; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our ESG goals is dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Principles of Consolidation Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets Pension Plan Valuations Revenue Recognition Income Taxes Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entitys voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise.

Please map the following input passage to one or more demographics listed above:

The elderly often have limited mobility and dexterity due to physical limitations caused by aging or chronic illnesses. They may find it difficult to perform daily tasks that require fine motor skills, such as buttoning shirts or tying shoelaces. Many seniors rely on caregivers to assist them with these activities, but some may feel embarrassed about needing help with what they view as basic tasks. Additionally, cognitive decline can make it hard for older adults to remember important information like appointments or medication schedules. Family members might need to take on more responsibility for managing their loved ones' affairs, which can create stress and emotional burden. Furthermore, social isolation is common among this age group since many retired individuals no longer interact regularly with colleagues at workplaces outside their homes.
