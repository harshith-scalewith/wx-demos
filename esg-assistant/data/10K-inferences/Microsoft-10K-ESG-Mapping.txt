Please map the following input passage to one or more demographics listed above:

The elderly often have limited mobility and dexterity due to physical limitations caused by aging or chronic illnesses. They may find it difficult to perform daily tasks that require fine motor skills, such as buttoning shirts or tying shoelaces. Many seniors rely on caregivers to assist them with these activities, but some may feel embarrassed about needing help with what they view as basic tasks. Additionally, cognitive decline can make it hard for older adults to remember important information like appointments or medication schedules. Family members might need to take on more responsibility for managing their loved ones' affairs, which can create stress and emotional burden. Furthermore, social isolation is common among this age group since many retired individuals no longer interact regularly with colleagues at workplaces outside their homes.
