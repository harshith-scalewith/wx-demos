Example:
Input passage:
Empowering women and girls is pivotal in our pursuit of a just and sustainable society. In the realm of environmental issues, they often bear the disproportionate burdens of climate change and resource depletion. Ensuring their access to education, resources, and decision-making roles can enhance resilience and drive sustainable practices. Within the criminal justice system, women and girls confront unique challenges. Gender bias and systemic inequalities can lead to unjust outcomes. Reforms aimed at addressing these disparities, including fair policing, sentencing, and support for marginalized communities, are imperative. By fostering gender equality and equitable justice, we pave the way for a more harmonious and sustainable future.
